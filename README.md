# OLCRE
This repository provides a reference implementation of the community detection algorithm described in the following research paper:

**Overlapping Community Detection Algorithm Based on High-quality Subgraphs Extension in Local Core Regions of Network**, Yang Zhao, Kun Deng, Xingyan Liu, Jiqiang Yao



## Running OLCRE

This algorithm is implemented in matlab and written in the file OLCRE.m. The community division of OLCRE algorithm on a network can be obtained by inputting the bilateral information of the network, and the community detection result is saved in a file.
